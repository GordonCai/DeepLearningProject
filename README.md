#### Description:
This team project explores three different deep reinforcement learning methods: deep Q networks, policy gradient, and deep deterministic policy gradient.  Each learning algorithm was evaluated on various simulated tasks that included Atari games and robotic control simulations.

### Dependencies
Each of our algorithms uses OpenAI Gym to provide the simulated environments.  OpenAI gym can be installed here:
https://github.com/openai/gym#installing-everything
In order to simulate all of our games here, you will need to do a full install.

### Run Instruction

#### DDPG:
Run python DDPG_Mountain_Car_Final.py.  This will run the basic continuous MountainCar-v0 environment.

#### DQN:

#### PG:
